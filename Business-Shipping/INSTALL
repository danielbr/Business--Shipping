NAME
    INSTALL - How to install Business::Shipping

NOTES
  Getting Started
    Be sure to read the "GETTING STARTED" section of the README, because
    some services (e.g. online tracking requests) require that the user
    signup for a username and password.

  Choosing your bundle
    If you would like to use UPS and USPS, install
    "Bundle::Business::Shipping". However, you may opt instead to install
    the required modules for only one:

    *   "Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline"

    *   "Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Online"

    *   "Bundle::Business::Shipping::USPS_Online"

    *   "Bundle::Business::Shipping"

CPAN INSTALLATION
    Note that the XML::DOM uses XML::Parser, and XML::Parser uses Expat.
    Therefore, you may need to install Expat before XML::Parser will
    install.

    All shippers:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'

    UPS_Online only:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline'

    UPS_Offline only:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline'

    USPS_Online only:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::USPS_Online'

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    Be sure to install all required modules before installing. After
    unpacking the tarball, execute the following:

     perl Makefile.PL [--use_defaults=<1|0>]
     make
     make test
     make install
