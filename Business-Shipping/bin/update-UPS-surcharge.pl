=head1 NAME

update-UPS-surcharge.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Installed by Business::Shipping.

Updates the fuel surcharge (stored in C<config/fuel_surcharge.txt>) from the UPS web site.  It is 
recommended that this be run every first Monday of the month in the early AM.  Here is an example 
line to add to your crontab:

 01 4 * * 1 Business-Shipping-UPS_Offline-update-fuel-surcharge.pl

That causes cron to run this update program at 4:01 AM every Monday.  Another good cronjob to have
is one that will update your Business::Shipping::DataFiles:

 01 4 * * 1 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Business::Shipping::DataFiles'
