Intended audience: developers who wish to modify Business::Shipping.

Patches are welcome. Style and guidlines are enfoced with Perl::Critic, with one
caveat: string eval in a few modules to allow for runtime loading of shipper 
modules. PerlTidy (perltidy -pbp -b -nst -nse -pt=2 -sbt=2 {}) is used.

Some of the code is for backwards-compatibility only.

The reason that the version is specified the same in every module is only to 
help in those rare circumstances where partial module installations exist in 
@INC so that old versions are mixed with new versions, as described here:
