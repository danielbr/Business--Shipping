INSTALL - How to install Business::Shipping

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Getting Started

Be sure to read the "GETTING STARTED" section of the README, because some 
services (e.g. online tracking requests) require that the user signup for a 
username and password.

=head2 Choosing your bundle

If you would like to use UPS and USPS, install C<Bundle::Business::Shipping>. 
However, you may opt instead to install the required modules for only one:

=over 4

=item * C<Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline>

=item * C<Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Online>

=item * C<Bundle::Business::Shipping::USPS_Online>

=item * C<Bundle::Business::Shipping>

=back

=head1 CPAN INSTALLATION

Note that the XML::DOM uses XML::Parser, and XML::Parser uses Expat.  Therefore,
you may need to install Expat before XML::Parser will install.

All shippers:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'

UPS_Online only:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline'

UPS_Offline only:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline'

USPS_Online only:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::USPS_Online'

=head1 MANUAL INSTALLATION

Be sure to install all required modules before installing.  After unpacking the 
tarball, execute the following:

 perl Makefile.PL [--use_defaults=<1|0>]
 make
