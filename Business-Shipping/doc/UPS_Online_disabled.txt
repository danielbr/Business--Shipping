UPS lawyers have claimed that the UPS_Online module violates their terms because
it is available to the public.  Therefore, I have disabled the UPS_Online module
(see line 3 of lib/Business/Shipping/UPS_Online/RateRequest.pm).  The 
UPS_Offline module is still enabled because it does not use the UPS OnLine 
Tools.
