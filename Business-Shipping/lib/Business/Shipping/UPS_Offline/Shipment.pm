=item * disable_hundredweight( )

If true, don't estimate the hundredweight rate even if it would otherwise be possible.

=item * hundredweight_margin( $percent )

If the shipment weight is only $percent (default 10%) higher than the required amount to qualify for 
hundredweight shipping, then do not calculate hundredweight.  This is to guard against the chance that the 
actual shipment weight turns out to be lower than what is used for estimation, resulting in failed eligibility
for hundredweight rates and a much higher rate than estimated.
