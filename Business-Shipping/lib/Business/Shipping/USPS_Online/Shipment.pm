Always returns 'US'.

=head2 to_country( $to_country ) 

Uses the name translaters of Shipping::Shipment::to_country(), then applies its
own translations.  The former may not be necessary, but the latter is.

=head2 packages_push

Syntatic sugar to avoid push @{$self->packages()}, $new_package;

=cut

sub packages_push {

    push @{ $self->packages() }, $new_package;
