Revision history for Business::Shipping.

1.04  CVS
	- Compatibility
		+ Scalar::Util 1.10 is now required (to pretty up the code a little).
		+ Created a Bundle::Business::Shipping module, uploaded to CPAN.
	
	- Offline::UPS
		+ Major fix to the low/high number/name scheme.  For international, it 
		  is now handled via split/rejoin, because the regex was choking on some
		  of the country names.  This was causing many zip code combinations
		  (that had lost their "high" in the last update), as well as some 
		  countries, to fail.
		+ Another fix for number range scheme.
		+ Sense validity for several combinations of service and country/zip.
		  (Ground Residential to Hawaii is now "invalid").
		+ New test for the Netherlands.

	- General
		+ New configuration parameter for this style:
		  service=XDM    to_country=Brazil
		  service=XDM    to_country=Canada       reason=Not available.

	- UserTag
		+ Add feature for not reporting "invalid" requests to the incident
		  generator.
		+ Pretty up the incident e-mail a little.

1.03  Jan 30 2004    
    - Compatibility:
        - Math::BaseCnv now required (for Offline::UPS to Canada, to convert 
          their witty base-36 zip codes to the lowly decimal number system).
        - from_state required for Offline::UPS.
    
    - General updates:
        - Move many datasets from the code into the configuration (USPS to_country,
          and others).
        - Auto-update function added.
        - Copyright update.
        - Aesthetic updates to most modules.

          config.
        - France, Russia, and other countries fixed for Offline::UPS.
        - Fix "Multiple shipments to Canada return 0 except the first" bug, caused
          by poorly implemented Zones class attribute: now correctly implement as a
          static hash, accessed by function.
        - Minor fixes: Express Plus.
        - Offline::UPS now supports all services to Canada, which completes all of 
          the Offline::UPS countries.
		- New error message for XDM to Canada.
		- Removed regexp that was causing an extra field to be put in the data.
	      (This fixed a lot of XDM shipments that weren't working before.)

		  (e.g. Malaysia+XDM).
		- Fixed: CA (Canada) was matching AfriCA.
