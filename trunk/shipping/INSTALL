NAME
    INSTALL - How to install Business::Shipping

NOTES
  Getting Started
    Be sure to read the "GETTING STARTED" section of the README, because
    some services (e.g. online rate requests) require that the user signup
    for a username and password.

  Forcing installation
    As of Sept 16, 2004, the following CPAN modules in
    Bundle::Business::Shipping did not pass their own tests on the author's
    system:

    * DBD::CSV: Failed 1/14 test scripts, 92.86% okay.
    * XML::DOM: Failed 5/21 test scripts, 76.19% okay.

    Even so, they seem to work fine after installation, but CPAN will not
    install them unless the "force" command prefix is used.

  Forcing version 2.x of Class::MethodMaker
    Class::MethodMaker::Engine is used as a prerequisite because it forces
    CPAN to retreive version 2.x of Class::MethodMaker.

  Choosing your bundle
    If you are planning on using all of the shipping methods, install
    "Bundle::Business::Shipping". However, if you would only like to install
    the required modules for one shipper, you can select it individually:

    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Online"
    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline"
    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping::USPS_Online"

CPAN INSTALLATION
    All shippers:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'force install DBD::CSV XML::DOM'
     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'

    UPS_Online only:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'force install XML::DOM'
     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline'

    UPS_Offline only:

     perl -MCPAN -e 'force install DBD::CSV'
     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline'
