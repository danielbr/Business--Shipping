INSTALLATION
    How to install Business::Shipping.

REQUIRED MODULES
    Bundle::DBD::CSV (any) Cache::FileCache (any) Class::MethodMaker::Engine
    (any) Clone (any) Config::IniFiles (any) Crypt::SSLeay (any)
    Getopt::Mixed (any) Log::Log4perl (any) LWP::UserAgent (any)
    Math::BaseCnv (any) Scalar::Util (1.10) XML::DOM (any) XML::Simple
    (2.05)

  CPAN INSTALLATION
     C<perl -MCPAN -e 'force install XML::Parser XML::Parser::PerlSAX XML::DOM'>
     C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'>

    As of June 25, 2004, some CPAN modules in Bundle::Business::Shipping do
    not pass their own tests:

    XML::Parser XML::Parser::PerlSAX XML::DOM

    Therefore, we recommend forcing their installation first. The manual
    insatllation of Class-MethodMaker 2.0 is required, since 1.12 is always
    selected if you only input "Class::MethodMaker".

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    This will install the Business::Shipping module (if you haven't already
    installed it via CPAN).

     perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

    Or, expressed on separate lines:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install
