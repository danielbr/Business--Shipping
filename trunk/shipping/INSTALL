    How to install Business::Shipping:

REQUIRED MODULES Archive::Zip (any) Bundle::DBD::CSV (any) Cache::FileCache (any) Class::MethodMaker::Engine (any) Clone (any) Config::IniFiles (any) Crypt::SSLeay (any) Data::Dumper (any) Devel::Required (0.03) Error (any) Getopt::Mixed (any) Log::Log4perl (any) LWP::UserAgent (any) Math::BaseCnv (any) Scalar::Util (1.10) Test::More (any) XML::DOM (any) XML::Simple (2.05)=head2 Module Installation via CPAN
     C<perl -MCPAN -e 'force install XML::Parser XML::Parser::PerlSAX XML::DOM'>
     C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'>

    As of February 10, 2004, two CPAN modules in Bundle::Business::Shipping
    do not pass their own tests. Therefore, we recommend forcing their
    installation first. The manual insatllation of Class-MethodMaker 2.0 is
    required, since 1.12 is always selected if you only input
    "Class::MethodMaker".

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    This will install the Business::Shipping module (if you haven't already
    installed it via CPAN).

     perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

    Or, expressed on separate lines:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install
