USAGE
     * For USPS: Sign up online for free:
 
            - http://www.uspswebtools.com
        
            - The online signup will result in a testing-only account (only a small
              sample of queries will work).  To activate the "production" use of your
              USPS account, you must follow the USPS documentation.  Currently, that
              means contacting the Internet Customer Care Center by e-mail or phone:
                icustomercare@usps.com
                    1-800-344-7779
    
     * For UPS: Sign up online for free:
 
            - https://www.ups.com/servlet/registration?loc=en_US_EC

            You will get a User Id, Password, and Access Key from UPS.
 
     * See Shipping.pm POD documentation for API and usage examples.

EXAMPLES
    This module is used by the Interchange E-Commerce software
    (http://www.icdevgroup.org). For a reference implementation of
    Business::Shipping, see the UserTag/business-shipping.tag file, it
    implements a function that takes shipping-related arguments, builds a
    Business::Shipping object, then returns the calculated cost.
