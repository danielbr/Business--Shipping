USAGE EXAMPLES
     * See Shipping.pm POD documentation for API and usage examples.

     * This module is used by the Interchange E-Commerce software 
       (http://www.icdevgroup.org).  For a reference implementation of 
       Business::Shipping, see the UserTag/business-shipping.tag file, it implements
       a function that takes shipping-related arguments, builds a Business::Shipping
       object, then returns the calculated cost.
