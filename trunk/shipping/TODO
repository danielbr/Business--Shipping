##  General TODO
######################################################
 
 
 * [ENH] Need to check for support_files() config param, and exit if files
   are missing.
 
 * [ENH] Allow the user to set the timeout for http requests.  Sometimes 30
   seconds is too long.

 * [DOC] Include the terms of use for each provider.
 
 * [BUG] When the internet is down, we should give a more useful error message
   than the following:
	 "Business::Shipping::RateRequest::Online::USPS::_handle_response: ()
     File does not exist:  at .../RateRequest/Online/USPS.pm line 202"
 
 * [BUG] Only Cache the response if it was a success (very important).
 
 * [BUG] Error on missing arguments isn't working very well ( user_id, password)
 
 * [BUG] Why do I have to 'use' all the modules in order for it to work?
 
 * [ENH] Change all scripts from #! /usr/bin/perl to $! perl
 
 * [ENH] Country name translator strings to data outside your program.
 	# TODO: Move all of this, and any other data that is currently mixed with 
	# code.
	# A simple, file-based configuration system would be nice, like Interchange.
	# Perhaps Config::Ini Configuration files?  Other?  Shipping::Config module
	# will provide parser, importer.  Any internal modules that use 
	# configuration will go through that module.  (it's an idea, anyway) 
 
 * [ENH] Enhance the debugging/error handling features: allow user to pass in a 
   callback ref conforming to some (customizable?) calling standard. 

 * [ENH] Is non-ssl communication with either provider possible?
 
 * [ENH] Migrate the "retry on failure" code from business-shipping.tag to 
   Business::Shipping proper.  Default to tries=2, but allow that to be
   overridden.  ("Failure" means HTTP 500 errors.)

 * [ENH] FedEx module: Christopher L Wenham from Synesmedia has created an 
   Interchange usertag that uses FedEx::DirectConnect for various functions.  
   Evaluate.
  
 * [ENH] Business::Shipping::OldUPS
    - Doesn't require signup (no username/password, etc.)
    - Utilize the new Business::UPS 2.0.
 
 * [ENH] Create Bundle::BusinessShipping
 
 * [ENH] The Shipping module itself should be able to be queried for what shippers it
   handles. Each shipper should be able to be queried for what services it 
   provides... maybe code would look like this:

	use Business::Shipping; 
	
	# Query the module for installed shipper specific modules.
	my @shippers = Business::Shipping::available_shippers(); 
	
	my %shipping_option; 
	for my $shipper (@shippers) { 
	
		# Services would be Ground, 2nd day air, things like that.
		my @services = $shipper->services();
	 
		for my $service (@services) { 
	
			# The $package would have been previously generated.
			$shipping_option{$shipper->name}->{$service} =
				$shipper->rate($service, $package); 
	
		}
	}
	
 * [ENH] Additionall module flexibility
	- Allow the use of Net::SSLeay as well as Crypt::SSLeay

 * [ENH] New feature ideas:
 	- Address Verification
	- Shipping status (package tracking)
	- Service Availability
	- Electronic Merchandise Return?
	- Shipping label generation?
	- Customs forms?
	- Shipping time (how long till it gets there)?
	- Delivery/Signature confirmation?

 * [ENH] After Table-based lookups are added, enable them as a fall-back to 
   online lookups.  That way, if the UPS/USPS servers are down, it will
   automatically utilize the table-lookup method.

##  USPS ONLINE TODO
######################################################
 
 * [BUG] Find a better way to correlate "Air mail" with all the various names
   it is called by each country.
 
 * [BUG] Not correctly realizing when there is an error (<Error><Number>...)
   - Perhaps because we don't ( KeepRoot => 1, ) on the XMLin()?

 * [ENH] Enable Cache for USPS.
 
 * [ENH] Support get_charges( 'service' ) for domestic types.

 * [ENH] Use the International Country Listing
	- http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/manuals/Imm/Immctry.pdf

##  UPS OFFLINE TODO
######################################################

 * [ENH] Look at the zone file comments to determine which zone file to use.
   (i.e. 970.csv has "970-01 to 972-99" -- means it actually does 970.csv too).
 
 * [ENH] Utilize GDBM, if available, to speed up lookups.

 * [BUG] Can't seem to find zone file for 97214, what gives?

 * [ENH] How to find the current fuel surcharge rate:
   - http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/find/cost/fuel_surcharge.html	
   - m/Effective.+: ?(\d\.\d\d\)%/
   
 * [ENH] Extended Area Surcharge: 
   - http://www.ups.com/media/en/extended_area_us.pdf

######################################################
##  UPS ONLINE TODO
######################################################
 
 * [BUG] Fix the multi-package API for UPS.  
   # TODO: Move to a different XML generation scheme, since all the packages 
   #       in a multi-package shipment will have the name "Package".
   # TODO: multi-package support: loop over the packages
   
 * [BUG] Return error message if trying to ship to military americas:
   - USP does not ship to APO or FPO addresses.

 * [BUG] Be able to handle "mal-formed XML doc" error return from UPS.  
 	- Right now, it still tries to parse as an XML doc.

 * [ENH] Allow better names, like "One Day Air" instead of 1DA.
   - Better names for packaging too (instead of numbers).
 
 * [ENH] Test for thread-safety-ness.	
 
 * [ENH] UPS support for sending multiple simultaneous requests
	- (USPS had built-in support in the API for Intl)
 	- If they don't support it, try LWP::Parallel::UserAgent.

##  Interchange UserTag TODO

 * [ENH] Test for ability to use within Safe?
