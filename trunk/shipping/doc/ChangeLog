Revision history for Business::Shipping
=======================================

1.90


  General
  
    * Renamed go() to execute(), but go() will continue to work for a long time.
    
    * Support multiple packages
      - Done for UPS_Offline
      - Add test cases

    * [Enh] Split overweight shipments into multiple packages 
      - Instead of mulitple shipments.
      - UPS allows each *package* in a shipment to be a max of 150 lbs.
      - Divide overweight shipments into multiple virtual shipments
      - Max weight per virtual shipment customizable
      - Add test cases
      
    * Moved a lot of files into doc/ so that the root directory would be a 
      little cleaner.

  UPS_Offline

    * [Enh] Major change: new data format for increased performance.
      - Instead of parsing UPS files at run-time, all the data is parsed into
        perl objects (like an in-memory database), and saved as Storable files. 
      - Significant performance increase and code simplification.
      - Reduces many required modules.
  
    * Add Hundredweight rate estimation 
    
    * [Fixed] .this_is_data did not make it into the release
      - Changed to this_is_the_data_dir
      

1.57  (unreleased)


  General
  
    * All significant changes and bugfixes in this version were completed 
      by Rubenstein Technology Group:  
      - Ed Zborowski <ed@rubensteintech.com> 
      - Martin H. Beauchamp <martin@rubensteintech.com>
      - Jaron Rubenstein <jaron@rubensteintech.com>
    
    * [Fixed] Class::MethodMaker 2.05 now works
      - Different default_ctor() usage.
      - Caused this error: "failure to initialize object with parameters: 
        Odd number of arguments for new"
    
    * Changed how errors were handled.  Instead of just generating an 
      message and exiting, the code now saves the error info to the object,
      generates a message, and exits if the error was fatal enough.  More
      than one error message is now stored.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping::Shipment was trying to load a package 
      that did not exist.  
      - Changed the package class from 
        Business::Shipping::Shipment::<Shipper> to 
        Business::Shipping::<Shipper>::Shipment.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping::UPS_Online::RateRequest could not generate
      xml for more than one package.  
      - Stored the packages in the hash as an array.  XML::Simple then 
        converts the array into seperate Package elements.      
    
    * Store results using hash instead of a hash ref.

    * Tests updated for all new code.
    
  Tracking
  
    * Made a lot of bugfixes and changes to get the UPS and USPS Tracking 
      modules working.
      
  USPS_Online
  
    * Use version 2 of the protocol.
    
    * Changed USPS rate code so that it correctly parsed the response XML
      and created a similar results data structure that UPS rate code 
      creates.
    
    * Only pass machinable information if the user stated it.
    
    * Added shipper to foward array in RateRequest shipment method.

    * [Fixed] Priority service always flat rate options.
      - Caused by always passing 'container', which implies flat-rate.

  UPS_Offline

    * Fuel Surcharge updates  
    
  Usertag
  
    * Reduced some of the error messages 
    
    * Changed variable names from "BS" to "BSHIPPING".

  General
  
    * [Fixed] Testing error in t/16_Pod-Coverage.t
    
    * [Enh] Minor documentation updates

  UPS_Offline
  
    * [Enh] 2005 Zones and Rates supported.
      - UPS changed the file format
      - See updated Business::Shipping::DataFiles
  
    * [Enh] Fuel surcharge auto-update
      - [Enh] Updated to work with new format introduced on 12/1/2004, which 
        now includes 2005 rates, and applies ground services as well as air.
      - [Fixed] Fuel surcharge auto-update bugs.
    
    * [Enh] Minor enhancements
      - [Enh] Preparation for the 2005 data.
      - [Enh] Data directory checks for ".this_is_data" file
      - [Enh] Check for missing columns while checking zone files
    
  Interchange Usertag
  
    * [Enh] Update usertag simulator test with recent usertag code.


1.55  Nov 22 2004

  General
  
    * Rewrite the 'service' parameter/function
      - User can specify full names such as 'Ground Residential' instead of
        GNDRES or 03.
      - Backwards-compatible
      - Allows easy retrieval of service names, codes, nicknames, etc.
      - Prepares the way for new UPS_Online 'Shop' service.
      
    * Rewrite the 'results' feature
      - Remove old 'packages' idea.
      - Make room for new UPS_Online 'Shop' service.
      - Not backwards-compatible, but results() was not intended to be public
        before.
    
    * Misc code cleanups
  
    * Remove some old utility functions.
    
    * [Fixed] Tests tried to load Cache::FileCache, even when the module was not 
      installed.  Now it tries to detect the module first.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping::RateRequest loaded Cache::FileCache even though
      it is not needed at that level anymore.
    
    * [Enh] Tests: check for username/password more consistently.
    
    * [Enh] Remove dependancy on updated version of Scalar::Util (now older 
      versions will work).
    
  UPS_Online
  
    * [Enh] New 'Shop' service.  Retrieve all the rates in one request.  Original 
      implementation by Selena Brewington <computers@chrisking.com>, later
      updated and modified. 
      - New tests added to cover the shop feature.
      - Example Usage:   
      
         my $rr_shop = Business::Shipping->rate_request( 
             service      => 'shop',    
             shipper      => 'UPS_Online',
             from_zip     => '98682',
             to_zip       => '98270',
             weight       => 5.00,
             user_id      => $ENV{ UPS_USER_ID },
             password     => $ENV{ UPS_PASSWORD },
             access_key   => $ENV{ UPS_ACCESS_KEY }
         );
         
         $rr_shop->go() or die $rr_shop->user_error();
         
         foreach my $shipper ( @$results ) {
             print "Shipper: $shipper->{name}\n\n";
             foreach my $rate ( @{ $shipper->{ rates } } ) {
                 print "  Service:  $rate->{name}\n";
                 print "  Charges:  $rate->{charges_formatted}\n";
                 print "  Delivery: $rate->{deliv_date_formatted}\n" 
                     if $rate->{ deliv_date_formatted };
                 print "\n";
             }
         }
    
    * [Enh] C.O.D. (Cash On Delivery) contributed by Selena Brewington
      <computers@chrisking.com>, with minor modifications.
      - To use, add these parameters to your rate request:
        
        cod            => 1,      # Enable C.O.D.
        cod_value      => 400.00, # C.O.D. value in USA dollars.
        cod_funds_code => 0,      # 0 = All funds allowed, 
	                          # 8 = money order only.

  UPS_Offline
  
    * [Enh] New program to update fuel surcharge automatically.
      - Run every first Monday of the month to get the new fuel surcharge
        from the UPS website.  
      - See bin/Business-Shipping-UPS_Offline-update-fuel-surcharge.pl for
        more information.
        
  Interchange UserTag
  
    * [Fixed] Several bugs and calling conventions.


1.54  Sep 21 2004


  General
    
    * [Enh] Major documentation updates and fixes
      - Added Test::Pod tests as well as Test::Pod::Coverage
      - Added POD for functions that lacked any.
    
    * [Enh] Major test updates
    
    * [Enh] Automatically detect which shippers can be supported based on the
      installed required modules.
      
    * [Enh] Skip tests that are for shippers that do not have their required
      modules installed.    
    
    * [Enh] Add "use_defaults=1" option to "perl Makefile.PL"
      - New options: -u=1 or --use_defaults=1: Use default values, do not ask 
        for values.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping requiring too many modules.  Switched to Basic.
    
    * [Fixed] Business::Shipping tests will fail if someone only installed
      Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline, because the testing scripts
      will not notice.
      - New system checks to see if prerequisite modules were installed before
        testing functionality that depends on them. 


1.53  Sep 17 2004


  General
  
    * [Fixed] [Doc] Reference to logdie in Shipping.pm.
    
    * [Done] [Enh] Allow preloading of modules
      - New optional syntax: 
        use Business::Shipping { preload => 'All' };
        use Business::Shipping { preload => 'USPS_Online' };
      - Without preloading, some modules will be loaded at runtime.  Normally, 
        runtime loading is the best mode of operation.  However, there are some
        circumstances when preloading is advantagous (see docs).
        
    * [Enh] Split the data into its own distribution, and add it to the bundle.
      - Business::Shipping::DataFiles - Offline cost estimation tables
      - Benefits: 
        + Allows data to be updated separately from the code.
        + It changes less often
        + Update scripts can just do a CPAN install of the latest data module.
      - Issues:
        + Chicken and Egg problem.  Can't install data first, because it needs
          Business::Shipping to know where to install.  Can't install Shipping
          first because it needs data in order to test.  Solution:  Check for
          pre-installed Business::Shipping and use that as the default, but ask
          anyway (for both).
          
    * [Enh] Add Business::Shipping::DataTools 
      - Converts shipper files into a format usable by Business::Shipping.
      - Most methods were removed from UPS_Offline::RateRequest where they were
        languishing.
    
    * [Enh] [Aesthetic] Prefix some private methods with "_".
    
    * [Enh] [Aesthetic] Code cleanups.

    * [Done] [Enh] Allow usage of LWP through a proxy
      - Suggested by Mark <MpoloN7@netscape.net>.
      - Uses environment variables to set the proxy settings. E.g.:
        http_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
        no_proxy="localhost,my.domain"
        export http_proxy no_proxy
        
    * [Done] [Enh] Provide multiple bundles (in the same distribution)
      - Bundle::Business::Shipping
      - Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline
      - Bundle::Business::Shipping::etc.
  
  All Online Modules
  
      * [Done] [Enh] Migrate the "retry on failure" code from the interchange 
        usertag [business-shipping] to Business::Shipping proper.  Default to 
        tries = 2.
    
  Tracking
  
    * [Enh] More progress on upgrade of tracking modules to C:MM 2.0. 


1.52  Sep 14 2004 
  
  
  General
  
    * [Enh] Allow users to change the runtime logging level.
      New Business::Shipping->log_level() method can override the log4perl.conf
      logging level.
      
    * [Done] [Enh] Resurrect the event_handlers() method for backwards 
      compatibility.  Mapped to Business::Shipping->log_level().
      
    * [Done] [Enh] [Log4perl] replace die and warn with logdie and logwarn.
    
    * [Fixed] ClassInfo/ClassAttribs does not trap all exceptions.
      
  USPS_Online
  
    * [Fixed] Missing module bugs
      - List of errors:
        "Can't locate Business/Shipping/Package/USPS.pm in @INC"
        "Can't locate Business/Shipping/Shipment/USPS.pm in @INC"
      - Caused by module name restructure in 1.51.
      - Reported by Micah Gersten <micah@davka.com>.


1.51  Sep 10 2004  


  Compatibility
  
    * Module names have been restructured.  When using 
      Business::Shipping->rate_request(), use the new values for 'shipper':
      shipper => 'UPS_Online',
      shipper => 'USPS_Online',
      shipper => 'UPS_Offline',
      
  General
  
    * [Enh] Die if path to support files is missing files.
    
    * [Enh] Restructure all of the modules
      - Keep everything the same, except the "lowest level":
          "RateRequest::Online::UPS"   => "UPS_Online::RateRequest"
          "RateRequest::Offline::UPS"  => "UPS_Offline::RateRequest"
          "RateRequest::Online::USPS"  => "USPS_Online::RateRequest"
          "Tracking::UPS" => "UPS_Online::Tracking"
      - Benefits:
        All of the related code is in one directory.
        All of the abstract code is in neutral directories.
      - Note: This will totally break the ClassInfo/ClassAttribs system, because 
        that system just uses the names, instead of actually checking the 
        inheritance trees.
        
    * [Enh] Update the ClassInfo/ClassAttribs system to handle the restructured
      module system.  Should use ISA instead of breaking down the name 
      components.  
      
    * [Fixed] [Bug] For Micah Gersten <micah@davka.com>, Business.pm was 
      'require'd.

      
1.50  Available in Software Change Management (SCM) only


  Compatibility

      - Surcharges weren't setup correctly
    - [Fixed] [BUG] Gaps in data are not accounted for.
      - Some UPS files (ww_xpr) do not have a record for every weight (Exceed = 55)

    - City added
    - Incident report enhancements.
    - Variable formatting fixes


1.06  Feb 11 2004


  General
    - Remove Bundle::Business::Shipping (now in its own distro, where it should 
      be).
  
          
1.05  Feb 10 2004


  General
    - Attempted fix for Bundle::Business::Shipping
    - Remove unneeded .zip files from data/
    - Minor documentation updates
   
        
1.04  Feb 07 2004


    - Compatibility
        + Scalar::Util 1.10 is now required (to pretty up the code a little).
        + Getopt::Mixed now required for some scripts.
    
    - General
        + Created a Bundle::Business::Shipping module, uploaded to CPAN, and add
          to CVS (removed in 1.06).
        + New configuration parameter for this style:
          service=XDM    to_country=Brazil
          service=XDM    to_country=Canada       reason=Not available.
        + Scripts moved from doc/ to bin/
        + Some scripts re-named.
        + Rename some of the tests.
        + Devel::Required patch no longer necessary.  Recent version implement
          the desired functionality.
        + Class::MethodMaker patch no longer necessary.  Subclassing is 
          sufficient.
        + Remove zip files from distribution, they take up too much space.
        + Move some configuration methods from Shipping to Shipping::Config.

    - Offline::UPS
        + Major fix to the low/high number/name scheme.  For international, it 
          is now handled via split/rejoin, because the regex was choking on some
          of the country names.  This was causing many zip code combinations
          (that had lost their "high" in the last update), as well as some 
          countries, to fail.
        + Another fix for number range scheme.
        + Sense validity for several combinations of service and country/zip.
          (Ground Residential to Hawaii is now "invalid").
        + New test for the Netherlands.
        + Update to February fuel surcharge (5%)
        + New invalid request: Anything but express to israel.
        + New tests for Israel.

    - UserTag
        + Add feature for not reporting "invalid" requests to the incident
          generator.
        + Pretty up the incident e-mail a little.

                
1.03  Jan 30 2004


    - Compatibility:
        - Math::BaseCnv now required (for Offline::UPS to Canada, to convert 
          their witty base-36 zip codes to the lowly decimal number system).
        - from_state required for Offline::UPS.
    
    - General updates:
        - Move many datasets from the code into the configuration (USPS to_country,
          and others).
        - Auto-update function added.
        - Copyright update.
        - Aesthetic updates to most modules.
        - Documentation updates for several modules.
        - Example script added for updating the Business::Shipping module.

        - Bug fixes for International Shipping
        - Add automatic translations for several values (state to abbreviation, 
          abbreviated country to the full name of the country, etc.) -- uses 
          config.
        - France, Russia, and other countries fixed for Offline::UPS.
        - Fix "Multiple shipments to Canada return 0 except the first" bug, caused
          by poorly implemented Zones class attribute: now correctly implement as a
          static hash, accessed by function.
        - Minor fixes: Express Plus.
        - Offline::UPS now supports all services to Canada, which completes all of 
          the Offline::UPS countries.
        - New error message for XDM to Canada.
        - Removed regexp that was causing an extra field to be put in the data.
          (This fixed a lot of XDM shipments that weren't working before.)
        - Fixed: Some country/service type records were not returning errors 
          (e.g. Malaysia+XDM).
        - Fixed: CA (Canada) was matching AfriCA.

    - Tests:
      - Additional UPS Online/Offline tests: Canada, Mexico.
      - More tests for Offline::UPS.
      - Updated the Interchange UserTag simulator, and make it a part of the
        standard testing scheme (instead of a manual test).
    
    - UserTag Updates:
        - Major enhancements.

        {
         'from_zip' => "98682",'cache' => "1",
         'to_country' => "Canada",'service' => "Airmail Letter Post",

        }
        )
