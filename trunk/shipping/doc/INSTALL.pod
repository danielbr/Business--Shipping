INSTALL - How to install Business::Shipping

=head1 NOTE

Be sure to read the "GETTING STARTED" section of the README if you plan to use
any online services (e.g. shipment tracking).

=head1 REQUIRED MODULES

 Business::Shipping::DataFiles (any)
 Cache::FileCache (any)
 Class::MethodMaker::Engine (any)
 Clone (any)
 Config::IniFiles (any)

=head2 CPAN INSTALLATION

 perl -MCPAN -e 'force install DBD::CSV XML::DOM'
 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'

As of Sept 16, 2004, the following CPAN modules in Bundle::Business::Shipping do
not pass their own tests on the author's system:

=over 4

=item * DBD::CSV: Failed 1/14 test scripts, 92.86% okay.

=item * XML::DOM: Failed 5/21 test scripts, 76.19% okay. 

=back

Even so, they seem to work fine after installation, but CPAN will not install 
them unless the "force" command prefix is used.  

Also, we have listed Class::MethodMaker::Engine as a required module because it
forces CPAN to retreive version 2.x of Class::MethodMaker. 

=head1 MANUAL INSTALLATION

Be sure to install all required modules before installing.  After unpacking the 
tarball, execute this command:

 perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

Or, expressed as separate commands:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install
