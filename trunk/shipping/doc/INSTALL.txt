NAME
    INSTALL - How to install Business::Shipping

NOTE
    Be sure to read the "GETTING STARTED" section of the README if you plan
    to use any online services (e.g. shipment tracking).

REQUIRED MODULES
    Bundle::DBD::CSV (any) Cache::FileCache (any) Class::MethodMaker::Engine
    (any) Clone (any) Config::IniFiles (any) Crypt::SSLeay (any)
    Getopt::Mixed (any) Log::Log4perl (any) LWP::UserAgent (any)
    Math::BaseCnv (any) Scalar::Util (1.10) XML::DOM (any) XML::Simple
    (2.05)

  CPAN INSTALLATION
     perl -MCPAN -e 'force install DBD::CSV XML::DOM'
     perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Business::Shipping'

    As of Sept 16, 2004, the following CPAN modules in
    Bundle::Business::Shipping do not pass their own tests on the author's
    system:

    * DBD::CSV: Failed 1/14 test scripts, 92.86% okay.
    * XML::DOM: Failed 5/21 test scripts, 76.19% okay.

    Even so, they seem to work fine after installation, but CPAN will not
    install them unless the "force" command prefix is used.

    Also, we have listed Class::MethodMaker::Engine as a required module
    because it forces CPAN to retreive version 2.x of Class::MethodMaker.

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    Be sure to install all required modules before installing.

    After unpacking the tarball, execute this command:

     perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

    Or, expressed as separate commands:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install
