NAME
    INSTALL - How to install Business::Shipping

NOTES
  Getting Started
    Be sure to read the "GETTING STARTED" section of the README, because
    some services (e.g. online rate requests) require that the user signup
    for a username and password.

  Choosing your bundle
    If you are planning on using all of the shipping methods, install
    "Bundle::Business::Shipping". However, if you would only like to install
    the required modules for one shipper, you can select it individually:

    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Online"
    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping::UPS_Offline"
    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping::USPS_Online"
    * "Bundle::Business::Shipping"
