 * Business::Shipping is used by the Interchange E-Commerce software 
   (http://www.icdevgroup.org).  For a reference implementation of 
   Business::Shipping, see the UserTag/business-shipping.tag file, it implements
   a function that takes shipping-related arguments, builds a Business::Shipping
   object, then returns the calculated cost.
